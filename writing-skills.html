		    Upskill: Improve your writing skills. Become more
		    employable locally and internationally with the help
		    of the Global Writing Centre (GWC). Register for our
		    Workplace Writing Course (WWC) and get REAL value for
		    your money!!
		</div>

		<p>
		    Writing skills are among key communication skills
		    many workplaces expect their employees to have,
		    especially in today’s globalised economies that are
		    driven by data, information, and knowledge. Many
		    employers, both locally and globally, are looking for
		    employees who can express themselves clearly and
		    effectively, using different kinds of written
		    workplace genres: memos, reports, submissions,
		    minutes, articles, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		    As part of our commitment to upskill the Namibian
		    workforce for the 21st century workplace, Global
		    Links & Consultants cc is offering you, among
		    other things, opportunities to improve your
		    writing skills, which are required in the
		    knowledge-driven economy.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Because the global market has shifted towards
		    valuing skills more than qualifications, emphasis
		    on our courses is placed on the acquisition of
		    know-how by doing. Unlike many writing courses
		    offered in the country, we focus on the processes
		    that writers go through and the products they
		    produce. Moreover, our writing courses consider
		    the social aspects of written communications and
		    not just the cognitive ones.
		</p>
